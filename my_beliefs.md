<h3><p align="center">The Doctrine of Christ</p></h3>

I believe in the Doctrine of Christ, as layed out in the [Book of Mormon](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm):

1. Come unto Christ
   - Broken Heart and Contrite Spirit
   - Exercize faith unto repentance
   - Keep His commandments (Specifically the ones He gives you personally)
   - Be baptized by water
2. Recieve the Baptism of Fire & The Holy Ghost
   - Recieve the First Comforter (The Holy Ghost)
   - Recieve a Remission of your sins
   - Enter the Gate
3. Endure to the End (Christ)
   - Walk the Straight and Narrow Path
      - This includes keeping His commandments
   - Hold to the Iron Rod[^1] (The Scriptures)
   - Feast on the Words of Christ
4. Eternal Life
   - Recieve the Second Comforter (Jesus Christ Himself)
   - Entering into the Rest of the Lord
   - The Kingdom of God

 <h3><p align="center">My Testimony</p></h3>

I am a Restoration Latter-Day Saint,
<br>
I believe in Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer of the world.
<br>
I believe Joseph Smith Jr. was a true Prophet, and that he translated the Book of Mormon by the power of God, which contains the fullness of the Gospel (along with the JST[^2] of the Bible).
<br>
I know the Book of Mormon to be the Word of God, and I know it contains the history of the Nephites and Lamanites, who came out of Jeusalem.
